#summary Format Detection Informations

= Introduction =
Classes in package `org.iotools.formats` try to ease the detection of some widely used file formats.   

These classes can tell you which is the format of the stream "on the fly", without you have to copy it to the disk for reading it twice.

This project is a small and easy tool.If you need more detailed format detection, and you don't care of streaming you should check out these projects:
